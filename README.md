# SQL Music Store Analysis

## What I Did
I analyzed a music store database using SQL to answer business questions about customers, sales, and products.

## Questions I Answered
1. Who are the top 10 customers by spending?
2. What music genres sell the best?
3. How do sales change month to month?
4. How are employees performing?
5. Where are customers located?

## What I Found
- Rock music is the most popular genre
- A small number of customers account for a lot of revenue
- Sales go up and down each month
- Customers come from all over the world

## Skills Used
- SQL queries with JOINs and GROUP BY
- Data analysis with Python
- Creating charts from SQL results
- Working with real databases

## Files
- Music store analysis notebook
- Charts showing customer spending and sales trends

*This was a practice project to build my SQL skills.*
